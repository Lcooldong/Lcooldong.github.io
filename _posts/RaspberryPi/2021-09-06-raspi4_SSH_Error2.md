## Situation <br>
After using terminus(mobile app) or something, I can't connect to my raspi4. <br>

## Trial <br>
1. I think I also use ufw of my raspi4. Maybe because of firewall, it can be diconnected. <br>

2. After fixing SSH connection of Putty, VSC is not working. So, I erase  ~\.ssh directory files only left config file. And I regen of public key by Puttygen. <br>

## Result <br>

It works well. But I don't know exactly what's cause and solution. <br>
After getting more experience, I will find them.
