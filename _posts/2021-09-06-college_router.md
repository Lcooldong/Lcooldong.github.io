I want to connect to my Raspberry pi from mobile data. <br>
My college has serveral routers that I can't approach. <br>

So, I use "ipconfig /all", "tracert", and "arp -a" in CMD. <br>
I think my college IP probably looks like that. <br>

I try to use Port Forwarding. But going to upper router was denied. <br>
