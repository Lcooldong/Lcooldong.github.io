title : Raspberry Pi4 20.04 SSH connection Error
---


I want to use my Raspberry Pi4 in External network.<br>
SO, I decide to connect by Visual Studio Code. <br>
But, it's not working.

Finally, I delete all files of SSH.<br>

It's not perfect solution. <br>

Things that I did to connect External network.<br>

1. Remove micro SD card and remake SSH file. <br>

2. Use TTL to USB. Putty Serial Port, Baud rate 115200. <br>

3. When Serial Port connected, there is nothing. But just write ID of your RaspberryPi. Then you can see password sentence.<br>

4. Mine is not working when I write [sudo systemctl start ssh] . <br>

5. -> sudo apt-get purge openssh-server <br>

6. -> sudo apt-get install openssh-server <br>

7. -> sudo systemctl status ssh <br>

8. -> sudo systemctl start ssh <br>

9. -> sudo sytemctl enable ssh <br>

10. -> sudo reboot <br>
